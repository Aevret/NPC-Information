# NPC-Information

This is an addon I created awhile back just to see what I could do with NPC's in an MMORPG type style. It will give them a random level and display their health above their head. With features such as a settings menu to choose what you want on the NPCs, like size, health and levels, it's how you want it! 

Type /npcinfo or press F3 to open the menu
